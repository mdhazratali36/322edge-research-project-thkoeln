This research enhances our understanding of cloud-native CI/CD practices by illustrating the differences between GitOps and traditional approaches across various development environments. Additionally, it provides practical advice for applying these strategies. The results offer clear recommendations for companies seeking to improve their CI/CD processes and adopt current DevOps methodologies.

# Performance Optimization of Cloud-Native CI/CD Pipelines: A Comparative Study of GitOps and Traditional Approaches

## Overview

This project compares the performance of traditional CI/CD pipelines (using Jenkins) versus modern GitOps pipelines (using ArgoCD) in cloud-native environments. The goal is simple: **find out which approach delivers faster, more reliable, and more scalable software deployments—using real implementation and actual performance metrics.**

## Tech Stack

- **Jenkins** – Traditional CI/CD orchestration
- **ArgoCD** – GitOps-based Continuous Delivery
- **GitLab** – Source code, CI config, Docker registry
- **Docker** – Containerization
- **Kubernetes** – Orchestration & deployment
- **Helm** – Kubernetes package management
- **Prometheus** – Monitoring
- **Grafana** – Visualization

## Implementation


### Traditional CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Repository & Code Management**  
   - Node.js app code managed in a GitLab repo.
   - Includes Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML manifests.
2. **Provision VMs (OpenStack)**
   - Separate VMs for Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes.
3. **Containerization**
   - Dockerfile builds app image.
   - Image pushed to GitLab Container Registry.
4. **Kubernetes Cluster Setup**
   - Cluster set up with `kubeadm`.
   - Deployment & Service YAMLs used for app rollout.
5. **Configure Jenkins Pipeline**
   - Jenkinsfile automates:  
     - Clone from GitLab  
     - Build Docker image  
     - Push image  
     - Deploy to K8s using `kubectl`
   - **Sample Jenkinsfile:**  
     ```groovy
     pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
         stage('Checkout') { steps { /* code */ } }
         stage('Build') { steps { /* code */ } }
         stage('Push') { steps { /* code */ } }
         stage('Deploy') { steps { /* code */ } }
       }
     }
     ```
6. **Monitoring**
   - Prometheus collects metrics from Jenkins/K8s.
   - Grafana dashboards visualize pipeline execution time, resource usage.

**Diagrams:**  
- Jenkins pipeline stages (add screenshots or diagrams)
- Grafana charts (pipeline timing, resource usage)


### GitOps Pipeline (ArgoCD)

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Repository Setup**  
   - GitLab repo with code, Dockerfile, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, Kubernetes manifests/Helm charts.
2. **Provision VMs**
   - VMs for Kubernetes and ArgoCD (via OpenStack).
3. **CI Configuration (GitLab CI)**
   - `.gitlab-ci.yml` builds/pushes Docker image, updates manifests.
   - Triggers CD process.
   - **Sample `.gitlab-ci.yml`:**
     ```yaml
     stages:
       - build
       - push
     build:
       script:
         - docker build -t $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG .
     push:
       script:
         - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
     ```
4. **CD via ArgoCD**
   - ArgoCD continuously syncs K8s cluster to match Git repo (declarative).
   - Rollbacks & drift correction are automatic.
   - **Diagram:** ArgoCD dashboard screenshot (add as image)
5. **Monitoring**
   - Prometheus & Grafana for real-time metrics and dashboarding.
