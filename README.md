# Performance Optimization of Cloud-Native CI/CD Pipelines: A Comparative Study of GitOps and Traditional Approaches

## Overview

This project compares the performance of traditional CI/CD pipelines (using Jenkins) versus modern GitOps pipelines (using ArgoCD) in cloud-native environments. The goal is simple: **find out which approach delivers faster, more reliable, and more scalable software deployments—using real implementation and actual performance metrics.**
